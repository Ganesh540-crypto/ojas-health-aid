## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### AI Processing Pipeline
```
User Query → Intent Classification → Mood Analysis → Context Building → 
Response Generation → Safety Check → Web Search (if needed) → 
Final Response → User Display
```

### Health Assessment Flow
```
Initial Symptom → Progressive Questions → Severity Analysis → 
Risk Assessment → Treatment Recommendations → 
Hospital Finder (if critical) → Follow-up Scheduling
```

### Emergency Protocol
```
Emergency Detected → Immediate Assessment → Local Emergency Services → 
Hospital Recommendations → Real-time Navigation → 
Caregiver Notifications → Follow-up Care
```

## 📊 Data Architecture

### Core Data Models
```typescript
interface HealthConsultation {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  symptoms: Symptom[];
  assessmentScore: number;
  recommendations: Treatment[];
  urgencyLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'emergency';
  followUpRequired: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface UserHealthProfile {
  id: string;
  medicalHistory: MedicalCondition[];
  currentMedications: Medication[];
  allergies: Allergy[];
  emergencyContacts: Contact[];
  preferences: HealthPreferences;
}
```

## 🔒 Safety Measures

### Medical Safety Protocols
1. **Never diagnose** - Only provide general information
2. **Always recommend professional consultation** for serious concerns
3. **Emergency escalation** - Immediate hospital recommendations for critical symptoms
4. **Medication safety** - Cross-reference drug interactions and allergies
5. **Mental health support** - Specialized responses for mental health queries

### Technical Safety
1. **Input validation** - Sanitize all user inputs
2. **Rate limiting** - Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
3. **Audit trails** - Log all health-related interactions
4. **Data encryption** - Protect sensitive health information
5. **Compliance monitoring** - Regular compliance checks

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### Advanced Components Planned
- `HealthMetricsDashboard` - Visual health tracking
- `MedicationScheduler` - Smart reminder system
- `SymptomJournal` - Track symptoms over time
- `TelehealthIntegration` - Video consultation interface
