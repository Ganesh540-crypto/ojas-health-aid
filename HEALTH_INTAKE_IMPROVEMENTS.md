# Health Intake UI Improvements - Completed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Compact UI with 2-Column Layout
- **Before**: Large modal with single-column options showing all at once
- **After**: Compact modal (`max-w-xl` instead of `max-w-2xl`) with responsive 2-column grid
- Options use `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-2.5` for better space utilization
- Reduced padding and sizing for more compact feel

### 2. ✅ Scrollable Content
- **Before**: All options displayed at once causing overflow
- **After**: Added `max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto` to question content area
- Options scroll smoothly when there are many choices
- Progress bar and navigation remain fixed

### 3. ✅ Smooth Animations
- **Before**: Abrupt transitions
- **After**: 
  - Modal entrance: `animate-in fade-in zoom-in-95 duration-300`
  - Question transitions: `animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-right-4 duration-300`
  - Option hover effects: `hover:scale-[1.02]` with smooth transitions
  - Auto-advance delay reduced to 500ms for snappier feel

### 4. ✅ Additional Details Input
- **Before**: Missing the final "additional details" step
- **After**: 
  - Added as final step after all questions
  - Shows textarea for users to add: medications, allergies, extra symptoms, context
  - Optional - users can skip and proceed directly
  - Progress bar accounts for this (+1 total steps)
  - Stored as `__additional` key in answers

### 5. ✅ Health Intake Animation Transition
- **Before**: Animation stayed on "Routing" for 5-7 seconds, then showed "Preparing health assessment" but didn't change
- **After**:
  - Immediately switches to `'analyzing'` mode with label "Preparing health questions"
  - Delay reduced from 1500ms to 400ms for faster transition
  - `setIsLoading(false)` called immediately so loading stops before modal appears
  - User sees proper transition: Routing → Preparing health questions → Modal appears

### 6. ✅ Language Issue Fixed (Hindi Default)
- **Before**: Gemini health model was generating Hindi responses by default even when English was selected
- **After**: 
  - Updated language instruction in `gemini.ts` (both sync and stream methods)
  - Added "DO NOT write in English or Hindi by default" to language note
  - Now explicitly tells model not to default to Hindi

### 7. ✅ Horizontal Rules (HR) Styling Fixed
- **Before**: Markdown horizontal rules (`---`) appeared as very thick/odd lines
- **After**: 
  - Added `prose-hr:border-t` to ensure proper border display
  - Combined with existing `prose-hr:my-8 prose-hr:border-border`
  - Now displays as subtle, professional dividers
