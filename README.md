Think of Ojas as a knowledgeable guide that explains, organizes, and helps you make informed decisions. It’s designed to be professional, approachable, and genuinely useful — not gimmicky.

## How Ojas works (high‑level)

Ojas gives structured, easy‑to‑read answers and, when needed, asks a few short questions to tailor guidance. It knows its knowledge cutoff is May 2024, so it searches the web for newer facts and shows a Sources panel you can inspect. Sources are displayed separately so the answer remains clean and readable.

Ojas aims to be India‑aware, sensitive to context, and consistent in tone. It avoids jargon where possible and focuses on clarity, safety, and empathy.

## Safety and medical guidance

- Ojas provides general information to help you make informed decisions. It is not a doctor and does not replace professional medical care.
- For emergencies (severe chest pain, breathing difficulty, stroke symptoms, heavy bleeding, allergic reactions), seek urgent medical help immediately.
- Ojas avoids giving dosing instructions and does not prescribe medications.
- Mental health is important. If you’re in crisis, seek immediate professional help or local emergency services.

## Privacy and data handling

We take privacy seriously. Ojas is designed so you remain in control of your conversations.

- Your chats are saved to your account so you can continue where you left off.
- We don’t sell your personal conversation data.
- You can manage your chat history from within the app.

Note: Please avoid sharing highly sensitive personal details unless necessary. Ojas is not intended to store protected health information for clinical use.

## Ojas Pulse — Comprehensive Health News

**Ojas Pulse** is our intelligent health news aggregation and synthesis system that generates 1000+ comprehensive, multi-source health articles daily.

### How Pulse Works

Unlike traditional news aggregators that simply collect existing articles, Pulse uses an advanced AI-driven approach:

1. **Query Generation**: Automatically generates 1000+ diverse health-related queries covering all major categories (mental health, fitness, nutrition, chronic diseases, preventive care, etc.)

2. **Multi-Source Research**: For each query, Pulse searches the web and gathers insights from 5-15 authoritative sources

3. **AI Synthesis**: Using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Pulse synthesizes information from multiple sources into comprehensive, well-structured articles with:
   - Engaging headlines
   - 200-300 word multi-paragraph summaries
   - 5-7 key insights
   - Proper categorization and tagging
   - Source citations
   - Urgency and location relevance assessment

4. **Quality & Freshness**: Articles are comprehensive, current, and provide multiple perspectives on health topics — similar to how Perplexity synthesizes information

2) How current is the information?

Ojas has a knowledge cutoff of May 2024. When up‑to‑date information matters (e.g., new guidelines or recent news), it performs a quick web search and shows a Sources panel for transparency.

3) Where does the information come from?

Ojas combines general medical knowledge with reputable online sources. You’ll see a Sources panel alongside answers when web search is used.

4) Is my data private?

Your chat history is tied to your account so you can pick up where you left off. We use secure, modern cloud infrastructure and do not sell your personal conversation data.

5) Does Ojas work outside India?

Ojas is designed with an India‑first mindset but can help with general health topics anywhere. Always follow local medical guidance and regulations.
