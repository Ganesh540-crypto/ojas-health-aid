# Google Weather API Setup

## You're absolutely right! Google DOES have a Weather API! üå§Ô∏è

The Google Weather API is part of **Google Maps Platform** and provides high-quality weather data.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable billing (required for API usage, but there's a free tier)

### Step 2: Enable Weather API

1. Go to [APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)
2. Search for "Weather API"
3. Click on "Weather API"
4. Click "Enable"

### Step 3: Create API Key

1. Go to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click "Create Credentials"
3. Select "API Key"
4. Copy your API key
5. (Recommended) Click "Restrict Key" and limit to:
   - API restrictions: Select "Weather API" only
   - Application restrictions: HTTP referrers (websites)
   - Add your website domain

### Step 4: Add API Key to .env File

1. Open or create `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your Google Weather API key:

```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_WEATHER_API=AIzaSyD...your-actual-key-here
```

3. **Important:** Restart your dev server after adding the key:
   - Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run `npm run dev` again
   
**Note:** The `.env` file is gitignored for security. Never commit API keys to Git!

### Step 5: Test

1. Clear browser cache: `localStorage.removeItem('ojas_weather_cache')`
2. Refresh page
3. Click weather refresh button
4. Check console for success message

## Pricing

Google Weather API has a **generous free tier**:

- **$200 free credit per month**
- Current conditions: $0.001 per call (1000 calls = $1)
- Daily forecast: $0.002 per call (1000 calls = $2)

With 6-hour caching, you'll make ~4 calls/day = **~$0.024/month** (well within free tier)

## Fallback System

The code has a fallback system:
1. **Try Google API** (best quality)
2. **On failure ‚Üí Dynamic mock data** (so app never breaks)

Mock data will:
- Generate current weekday names
- Create realistic varying temperatures
- Update every time (not stuck on old values)
